# Goal 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

## Target 15.4: By 2030, ensure the conservation of mountain ecosystems, including their biodiversity, in order to enhance their capacity to provide benefits that are essential for sustainable development

### Indicator 15.4.2: Mountain Green Cover Index

#### International organisations(s) responsible for global monitoring:

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

#### Definition:

Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) is defined as the percentage of green cover over the total surface of the mountain region of a given country and for given reporting year. MGCI is designed to measure the extent and the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas - i.e. forest, shrubs, trees, pasture land, cropland, etc. The aim of the index is to assess the status of conservation of mountain ecosystems.

#### Concepts:

The Mountain Green Cover index is based on two descriptor layers of information:

#### 1. Mountain descriptor layer:

The global mountain descriptor layer is based on the mountain classification proposed by Kapos et al. (2000):

• Class 1: elevation > 4500 meters

• Class 2: elevation 3500 - 4500 meters

• Class 3: elevation 2500 – 3500 meters

• Class 4: elevation 1500 – 2500 meters and slope ≥ 2

• Class 5: elevation 1,000–1,500 meters and slope ≥ 5 or local elevation range (7 kilometers radius) ≥ 300 meters

• Class 6: elevation 300–1,000 meters and local elevation range (7 kilometres radius) ≥ 300 meters outside 23°N—19°S

• Class 0: Defined to represent the non-mountainous areas.

The mountain description layer used to derive the global estimates was created by the US Geological Survey from a 250 m DEM (Sayre et al. 2018)
